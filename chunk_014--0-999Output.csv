Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D651,No Action,0.90,Email appears legitimate with good authentication (SPF/DKIM pass), no malicious indicators, clean attachments, and appropriate security features. The low domain reputation score is compensated by other positive signals.
D652,Warning,0.75,Sender spoofing detected with high temporary email likelihood (0.72). Contains winword.exe parent process and high AMSI score (0.88). Meeting request with moderate risk indicators warrant caution but not immediate blocking.
D653,Spam,0.85,Contains malicious attachment with executable present, failed SPF/DKIM, and suspicious winword.exe process. Low sender reputation with moderate behavioral scores indicate spam with potential malicious intent.
D654,No Action,0.92,Clean email with no malicious indicators, good authentication (except DKIM), no attachments, and legitimate URL behavior. Low risk profile across all signals.
D655,Malicious,0.88,High threat indicators: executable attachment, very high sandbox execution score (0.93), suspicious outlook.exe process, failed SPF, and legal threat request type. Multiple red flags indicate malicious phishing attempt.
D656,Malicious,0.91,Extreme risk: high suspicious metadata (0.52), elevated behavioral sandbox score, suspicious acrobat.exe process, self-signed SSL certificate, failed SPF, and link click request. Clear malicious intent.
D657,Warning,0.70,Elevated risk with sender reputation issues, failed SPF, expired SSL certificate, URL redirect chain, and bank detail update request. Potential BEC attack but lacks strong malicious indicators.
D658,Malicious,0.95,Very high threat: 8 IOC counts, high behavioral scores (0.82 exfiltration), powershell.exe process detected, VPN/MFA reset request, and suspicious network behavior. Clear credential theft attempt.
D659,Malicious,0.93,Extreme malicious indicators: max metadata score (0.97), high behavioral sandbox score (0.43), powershell.exe process, failed DMARC, VPN/MFA reset request. Sophisticated attack attempt.
D660,Warning,0.78,Mixed signals: sender known malicious flag but with macros present, SSL issues, and suspicious processes. However, bulk indicator suggests possible false positive on malicious sender flag.
D661,No Action,0.88,Clean profile with good authentication, no attachments, invoice verification request seems legitimate given other clean signals. Low risk overall.
D662,Malicious,0.89,High risk indicators: suspicious metadata (0.28), exfiltration behavior (0.94), powershell.exe process, failed SPF, embedded files detected. Clear data theft attempt.

D666,No Action,0.90,Very clean profile with good authentication, domain known malicious flag appears false positive given all other clean signals. Legitimate email.
D667,No Action,0.87,Good overall security profile despite failed SPF, no malicious indicators, clean attachments. Authentication issues likely configuration related.
