D84,Malicious,0.91,"High-risk malicious email: significant metadata suspicious score (0.4169), moderate behavioral sandbox activity (0.0104), AMSI suspicion (0.0963), high exfiltration behavior (0.5856), process execution (winword.exe, powershell.exe, regsvr32.exe), urgency targeting (1.0), authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM policy, DMARC fail), self-signed certificate indicating poor security infrastructure, high URL rendering behavior (0.4157). Multi-vector document-based attack with process execution chains."
D85,Warning,0.78,"Warning classification due to mixed signals: moderate sender domain reputation (0.3221), high temp email likelihood (0.5574), wire transfer request (high-risk BEC type), urgency targeting (0.5), authentication mixed (SPF pass, DKIM neutral, DMARC pass), good URL reputation (0.0693), minimal content spam score (0.0048). Sender reputation and request type warrant caution but strong authentication suggests legitimate infrastructure."
D86,Warning,0.82,"Warning classification: minimal sender reputation concerns (0.0222), urgency targeting (1.0) indicates social engineering attempt, high reply path reputation issues (0.3657), expired SSL certificate raises security concerns, high URL rendering behavior (0.8475) indicates suspicious redirect patterns, multiple URLs (2) with moderate reputation (0.5796).
