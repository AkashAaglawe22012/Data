Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D93,No Action,0.85,Low risk profile with good domain reputation (0.689) and passing SPF authentication. Request type is sensitive data retrieval but lacks malicious indicators like attachments or suspicious URLs. TLS 1.3 encryption and valid token suggest legitimate communication.
D94,Warning,0.75,Meeting request with mixed signals - has suspicious parent process (winword.exe) and failed DMARC check. Low domain reputation score (0.0009) and presence of network activity raises concerns. However no malicious attachments detected and valid SSL certificate present.
D95,Malicious,0.90,Critical security violations including DMARC enforcement enabled but failing authentication. Multiple suspicious parent processes (winword.exe) detected with high exfiltration score (0.846). Domain flagged as potentially malicious with very low reputation. Request type unspecified adds to risk profile.
