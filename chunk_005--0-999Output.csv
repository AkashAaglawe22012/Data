Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D201,No Action,0.80,"Low-risk email with minimal suspicious indicators. All critical threat signals are zero (sender not malicious, no attachments, no malicious content). Authentication mixed (SPF softfail, DKIM permerror, DMARC none) but no actionable threats detected. Valid SSL certificate and minimal behavioral scores indicate legitimate communication."
D202,Malicious,0.89,"High-confidence malicious classification. Sender flagged as known malicious (1.0), high temporary email likelihood (0.17), authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM fail, DMARC fail), self-signed SSL certificate. Malicious sender designation takes priority for threat classification."
D203,Malicious,0.87,"High-confidence malicious classification. Sender flagged as known malicious (1.0), gift card request type, self-signed SSL certificate. Despite minimal behavioral indicators, malicious sender flag takes priority for threat classification."
D204,Malicious,0.92,"High-confidence malicious classification. Sender flagged as malicious (1.0), executable attachment detected, high exfiltration behavior score (0.72), wire transfer request type, process execution detected (winword.exe). Multiple critical malicious indicators align."
D205,Malicious,0.94,"Very high confidence malicious with sender flagged (1.0), high metadata suspicious score (0.20), YARA matches (2), document download request, reply path known malicious, high URL rendering behavior score (0.77). Strong malicious behavioral patterns."
D206,No Action,0.75,"Low-moderate risk with good authentication patterns and no critical malicious indicators. All behavioral and attachment scores are minimal, valid SSL certificate. Moderate return path reputation concern (0.36) insufficient for higher classification."
D207,Warning,0.66,"Moderate risk due to sensitive data request type and high SMTP reputation concern (0.92). Authentication failures (SPF fail, DKIM policy, DMARC fail) and moderate site visual similarity score (0.50) warrant monitoring."
