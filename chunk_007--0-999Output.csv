Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D301,Malicious,0.85,Email contains 3 malicious attachments with moderate sender reputation (0.74) and meeting request type. Multiple embedded files with winword.exe parent process indicate document-based malware. High exfiltration behavior score (0.405) confirms data theft attempts. Despite passing SPF the malicious attachment count is definitive.
D302,No Action,0.90,Clean email with excellent sender reputation (0.008) and no malicious indicators. All behavioral scores near zero with no executable attachments or suspicious processes. High reply path reputation (0.602) and passing SPF authentication confirm legitimacy. Safe business communication.
D303,Spam,0.75,Known malicious sender flag with poor domain reputation (0.139). No attachments but high reply path reputation concerns (0.690). While authentication passes the malicious sender designation and poor domain metrics indicate spam distribution rather than targeted attack.
D304,Malicious,0.90,High-risk email with executable attachment and legal threat request type. Poor sender reputation (0.489) combined with high exfiltration behavior (0.636) and failing SPF/DMARC authentication. Outlook.exe parent process with embedded files confirms sophisticated BEC/extortion attempt.
D305,Warning,0.70,Link click request with high temp email likelihood (0.194) raises concerns. Adobe Acrobat parent process with 4 redirect chains suggests phishing attempt. While no malicious files detected the high reply path reputation (0.629) and failing DMARC warrant caution.
D306,Warning,0.75,Bank detail update request with good sender reputation (0.764) but domain known malicious flag set. While no direct malware the sensitive financial request type combined with domain reputation issues and authentication failures (SPF softfail DMARC temperror) warrant caution.
D307,Malicious,0.95,Critical VPN/MFA reset attack with PowerShell execution behavioral sandbox score (0.217) and high exfiltration (0.406). Self-signed SSL certificate with failing DKIM/DMARC confirms credential theft attempt. Immediate blocking required for this sophisticated phishing attack.
D308,Warning,0.80,Wire transfer request with mixed signals - good sender reputation (0.635) but very high temp email likelihood (0.519). Self-signed certificate and 4 URLs detected. High SMTP geo risk (0.367) suggests compromised or suspicious infrastructure despite no malware.
D309,Malicious,0.85,Gift card request scam with PowerShell and regsvr32 execution showing advanced evasion. Extremely high exfiltration behavior (0.786) and high SMTP geo risk (0.838). Multiple process chains indicate BEC attempt despite no malicious file hashes.
D310,Malicious,0.90,Known malicious sender with 2 YARA rule matches confirming malware patterns. Excel parent process with very high metadata suspicious score (0.546) indicates macro-based attack. High SMTP geo risk (0.615) and failing DKIM/DMARC authentication support threat classification.
D311,Warning,0.75,DMARC enforced email with high temp email likelihood (0.296) and moderate metadata score (0.366). PowerShell execution detected with moderate exfiltration risk (0.547). While not definitively malicious the behavioral patterns and embedded files warrant monitoring.
D312,Warning,0.70,Invoice verification with domain known malicious flag set. While behavioral scores are minimal the malicious domain combined with authentication failures (SPF softfail DKIM fail DMARC temperror) and invoice request type suggest potential invoice fraud attempt requiring verification.
D313,Warning,0.80,DMARC enforced with return path mismatch raising spoofing concerns. PowerShell execution detected with low but present behavioral risks. While scores are low the authentication mismatches and script execution warrant careful monitoring.
D314,Warning,0.70,Moderate sender reputation (0.237) with PowerShell and regsvr32 execution chains. Low behavioral scores but high SMTP ASN reputation concerns (0.482). Authentication failures (SPF softfail DMARC fail) suggest potential reconnaissance activity.

D316,Warning,0.70,Extremely high temp email likelihood (0.789) with high SMTP geo risk (0.726) raises significant concerns. While behavioral scores are clean and authentication passes the temporary email pattern with high site visual similarity (0.427) suggests potential brand impersonation attempt.
D317,No Action,0.85,Bank detail update request with good overall profile. High return path reputation concern (0.726) but self-signed certificate appears intentional. Clean behavioral indicators and passing SPF suggest legitimate but poorly configured business email.
D318,No Action,0.90,Excellent profile with near-zero risk scores across all metrics. High content spam score (0.257) but offset by clean technical indicators. High URL rendering behavior score (0.716) suggests legitimate dynamic content rather than malicious behavior.
D319,Spam,0.80,Gift card request with reply path difference indicating scam attempt. Self-signed certificate and moderate SMTP reputation concerns. While no malware detected the social engineering pattern and authentication issues confirm spam/scam classification.
D320,Malicious,0.95,Wire transfer BEC with executable attachment and network call behavior detected. High exfiltration score (0.428) with failing SPF/DMARC. Very high URL reputation risk (0.463) and content spam score (0.329) confirm sophisticated fraud attempt.
D321,Malicious,0.98,Extreme threat with maximum metadata suspicious score (0.997) and very high exfiltration behavior (0.889). Document download request with near-maximum URL reputation risk (0.915). High content indicators confirm advanced malware delivery attempt.
D322,Spam,0.70,Known malicious sender with 4 URLs but minimal other threats. High SMTP reputation concerns (0.858) and content spam score (0.399). Authentication failures suggest bulk spam campaign rather than targeted attack.
D323,Warning,0.75,Sensitive data request with complete authentication failure (SPF/DKIM/DMARC fail). High content spam score (0.466) suggests phishing attempt. While no malware present the request type and authentication failures warrant user awareness training.

D325,Warning,0.80,Failed all authentication checks with behavioral sandbox score (0.197). Outdated SSL protocol and low but concerning behavioral indicators. While not definitively malicious the complete authentication failure warrants enhanced scrutiny.
D326,No Action,0.85,Clean profile despite high return path reputation concern (0.481). Very low risk scores and passing SPF with permerror DKIM. High URL reputation concern (0.557) but no behavioral indicators suggest monitoring only.
D327,Malicious,0.88,Legal threat with exploit pattern detected and return path known malicious. Despite moderate scores the exploit detection combined with failed DMARC and legal threat social engineering confirms malicious intent requiring immediate action.
D328,Malicious,0.95,Link click attack with YARA rule match and executable attachment. Extremely high temp email likelihood (0.918) with high exfiltration behavior (0.670). Self-signed certificate and very high spam content (0.781) confirm advanced phishing.
