Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D51,Warning,0.72,Email shows moderate risk with suspicious processes (winword.exe/powershell.exe), YARA matches detected, elevated behavioral sandbox score (0.43), high exfiltration score (0.68), expired SSL certificate, and very high content spam score (0.72). PowerShell execution with behavioral anomalies requires close monitoring.
D52,No Action,0.90,Email appears legitimate with low risk scores across all detection signals. Reply path reputation elevated (0.80) but no malicious content, clean process execution, valid SSL certificate, and passing authentication. Safe communication pattern.
