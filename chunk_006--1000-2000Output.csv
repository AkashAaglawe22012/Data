D86,No Action,0.85,"Email shows minimal risk indicators across all 68 signals. Sender not known malicious (0), good domain reputation (0.0059), no spoofing detected, no malicious attachments, SPF passes with DKIM/DMARC failures likely due to configuration issues. SMTP IP flagged malicious (1) but single URL has excellent reputation and valid SSL. No urgency keywords or high-risk request types detected."
D87,No Action,0.92,"Exceptionally clean email profile with perfect authentication triad (SPF/DKIM/DMARC all pass), extremely low sender domain risk (5.91e-13), DMARC enforced (1), no malicious attachments or behaviors. Contains 2 URLs but all show safe reputation scores. TLS 1.3 encryption, valid SSL certificate. QR code present but marked non-malicious (1). No urgency patterns or suspicious request types."
D88,Spam,0.78,"High temporary email likelihood (0.752) strongly indicates spam source. Failed SPF authentication while DKIM neutral, very low domain reputation scores suggest bulk/automated sending. No attachments present but exhibits bulk messaging characteristics. HTML/text ratio normal but temporary email usage and authentication failures point to spam rather than malicious intent."
