Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D2000,No Action,0.95,Email shows low risk indicators with no malicious attachments or exploits. Good sender reputation score (4.46e-07) near 0 indicates low reputation but not malicious. No executable attachments or suspicious behaviors detected. SPF passes and TLS encryption used. No urgency keywords or suspicious request types present.
D2001,Spam,0.85,Email exhibits typical spam characteristics with moderate sender reputation (0.38) and low temporary email likelihood. Contains sensitive data request type which is suspicious. SPF fails but no malicious attachments detected. Has marketing indicators with no executable files or exploits present.
D2002,Malicious,0.92,Clear malicious indicators including file metadata suspicious score (0.0498), high exfiltration behavior score (0.624), 3 YARA rule matches, and 7 embedded files. Contains winword.exe parent process and meeting request type. DMARC fails and moderate sender reputation issues indicate sophisticated attack.
D2003,Malicious,0.94,Strong malicious signals with file hash marked malicious, high metadata suspicious score (0.131), very high exfiltration score (0.599), and 7 embedded files. SPF softfail and DKIM/DMARC failures indicate spoofing. Self-signed SSL certificate and high URL reputation risk score (0.83) confirm phishing attempt.
D2004,No Action,0.88,Low risk profile with no malicious attachments or suspicious behaviors. Good sender reputation and no executable files. SPF passes with valid SSL certificate. Domain marked for URL generation but overall clean security posture with minimal threat indicators.
D2005,Warning,0.75,Mixed signals with executable attachment present, moderate suspicious scores, and VBScript detected. ActiveX objects found with exfiltration behavior (0.295). However, SPF passes and no file hashes marked malicious. Legal threat request type raises concern but not definitively malicious.
