Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D94,Warning,0.75,Meeting request with high metadata suspicious score (0.500), moderate exfiltration behavior (0.383), failed SPF. No malicious attachments or domains detected. Elevated risk due to metadata anomalies and authentication failure but lacks definitive malicious indicators.
D95,Warning,0.70,Temporary email likelihood (0.558) indicates potential spam source, self-signed SSL certificate raises trust concerns. Low threat scores across behavioral analysis. Warning due to sender reputation and SSL issues without active malicious content.
D96,No Action,0.85,Clean profile with no malicious indicators. All behavioral scores at zero, valid SSL certificate, no suspicious attachments. Failed DMARC but this alone insufficient for action. Legitimate email.
