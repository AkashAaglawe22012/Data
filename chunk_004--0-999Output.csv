Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D151,No Action,0.85,"Low-risk email with minimal suspicious indicators. All critical threat signals are zero (sender not malicious, no spoofing, no attachments, no malicious content). Authentication mostly passed (SPF fail but DKIM/DMARC pass). Minor domain reputation concerns (0.018) and temporary email likelihood (0.26) but insufficient for higher classification."
D152,No Action,0.75,"Moderate-risk profile but insufficient for higher classification. Sender domain has better reputation (0.19), low temporary email likelihood. All malicious attachment and behavioral indicators are zero. Authentication mixed (SPF pass, DKIM fail, DMARC fail) but no actionable threat content detected."
D153,No Action,0.82,"Low-risk email with good authentication posture. All malicious indicators are zero, good return path reputation (0.09), reasonable domain reputation. Authentication partially successful (SPF pass, DKIM policy, DMARC none). No executable attachments or suspicious behaviors detected."
D154,Warning,0.70,"Elevated risk due to gift card request type combined with suspicious authentication patterns. High urgency sentiment (0.95), gift card request pattern, mixed authentication (SPF softfail, DKIM none, DMARC permerror), and moderate content spam score (0.07). Self-signed SSL certificate adds to suspicion."
D155,Malicious,0.95,"High-confidence malicious classification. Sender flagged as malicious (1.0), suspicious metadata score (0.024), moderate behavioral sandbox activity, wire transfer request type, and concerning authentication patterns. Multiple risk factors align to indicate targeted financial fraud attempt."
D156,Malicious,0.92,"Strong malicious indicators with sender flagged as known malicious (1.0), significant metadata suspicious score (0.097), behavioral sandbox score (0.013), and document download request. Process execution detected (winword.exe) with moderate exfiltration behavior score (0.61)."
D157,No Action,0.78,"Low-risk legitimate communication. All malicious flags are zero, good domain and email authentication patterns. Minimal spam score, valid SSL certificate, normal email characteristics. No suspicious behaviors or content detected."
D158,Warning,0.65,"Moderate concern due to sensitive data request type and authentication failures. Mixed authentication results (SPF pass, DKIM policy, DMARC fail), sensitive data request pattern, but low overall threat scores. URL shortener detected adds minor risk."
D159,Malicious,0.88,"High-risk malicious activity. Sender flagged as malicious (1.0), executable attachment detected, meeting request type, moderate metadata suspicious score (0.003), and concerning behavioral indicators. Authentication partially successful but malicious sender overrides."
D160,Malicious,0.90,"Strong malicious classification with sender flagged (1.0), executable attachment, moderate behavioral scores, and QR code present (1). Authentication mixed results but malicious sender designation and behavioral indicators support high-risk classification."
D161,No Action,0.70,"Low-risk email despite high temporary email likelihood (0.76). All malicious indicators are zero, no attachments, reasonable authentication (SPF fail but DKIM pass). High temporary email score alone insufficient for elevated classification."
D162,Malicious,0.93,"High-confidence malicious with sender flagged (1.0), very high metadata suspicious score (0.458), high-risk role targeted, moderate behavioral scores, legal threat request type. Strong alignment of malicious indicators."

D164,Warning,0.68,"Moderate risk due to bank detail update request type and revoked SSL certificate. High temporary email likelihood (0.27), unsubscribe link present suggesting bulk distribution, but no direct malicious indicators."
D165,Malicious,0.86,"High-risk classification due to sender being malicious (1.0), high behavioral scores, ActiveX objects detected, VPN/MFA reset request type. Expired SSL certificate and concerning process execution patterns."
D166,Warning,0.72,"Elevated risk due to urgent callback request type and expired SSL certificate. Reply path different from sender, high urgency sentiment, but sender not flagged as malicious. Authentication generally good."
D167,Malicious,0.91,"Strong malicious classification with sender flagged (1.0), macro-enabled document, high urgency content score (0.94), process execution detected, and self-signed SSL certificate. Multiple high-risk indicators align."
D168,Warning,0.73,"Moderate risk profile with mixed authentication (SPF fail, DKIM pass, DMARC fail), return path known malicious, link click request, high URL reputation score concern (0.67). Sender not flagged but concerning patterns."
D169,Malicious,0.94,"High-confidence malicious with sender flagged (1.0), malicious file hash detected, high behavioral scores, multiple process executions including cmd.exe and powershell.exe. Critical malicious attachment indicator."
D170,Malicious,0.87,"Strong malicious indicators with sender flagged (1.0), very high metadata suspicious score (0.557), ActiveX objects detected, wire transfer request, unsubscribe link suggests phishing template. High-risk financial fraud."
D171,Warning,0.66,"Moderate concern due to wire transfer request type and high-risk role targeting. Good authentication but concerning request pattern and moderate domain reputation issues warrant monitoring."
