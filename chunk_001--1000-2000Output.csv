Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D94,Warning,0.75,"Email contains executable attachment with moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.194) and high exfiltration behavior score (0.695). Although sender is not known malicious and authentication passes (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), the executable attachment combined with meeting request type and high exfiltration risk requires warning classification."
D95,Malicious,0.85,"Email shows multiple high-risk indicators: 3 YARA rule matches, very high exfiltration behavior score (0.868), DMARC authentication failure, outdated TLS 1.0, and self-signed SSL certificate. The combination of failed authentication, high exfiltration risk, and multiple detection signals indicates malicious intent."
D96,Spam,0.70,"Email sender uses very high likelihood temporary email address (0.907) with DMARC authentication failure. While no malicious content detected, the combination of disposable email usage and failed authentication suggests spam/low-quality sender trying to evade detection."
D97,Malicious,0.95,"Email contains critical malicious indicators: 2 malicious attachments, obfuscated/packed attachment, high exfiltration behavior score (0.649), legal threat social engineering tactic, and SPF authentication failure. Multiple malicious attachments with packer detection confirms malicious intent."
D98,Warning,0.80,"Email targets high-risk role (VIP targeting) with very high exfiltration behavior score (0.814), link click request type, poor URL reputation (0.701), and expired SSL certificate. Despite passing authentication, the combination of VIP targeting, high exfiltration risk, and suspicious URLs warrants warning classification."
D99,Warning,0.65,"Email contains bank detail update request which is a common BEC (Business Email Compromise) social engineering tactic. Although all technical indicators are clean and authentication passes, the request type alone poses significant financial fraud risk requiring user caution."
D100,Malicious,0.90,"Email has very high exfiltration behavior score (0.686), self-signed SSL certificate, VPN/MFA reset request type (credential harvesting), and SPF authentication failure. The combination of credential harvesting attempt, high exfiltration risk, and failed authentication indicates malicious intent."
D100,Warning,0.75,"Email shows high behavioral sandbox score (0.890), moderate exfiltration behavior score (0.377), VPN/MFA reset request, and high content spam score (0.561). Multiple suspicious indicators warrant warning classification despite some authentication passing."
D81,Warning,0.70,"Email has very high exfiltration behavior score (0.543), moderate behavioral sandbox score (0.146), and DMARC authentication failure. The combination of high exfiltration risk and failed authentication requires warning classification."
D82,No Action,0.60,"Email shows minimal malicious indicators with very low behavioral scores, passed SPF authentication, and no dangerous request types. All critical security signals are within acceptable ranges indicating legitimate email."
D83,Warning,0.75,"Email contains high exfiltration behavior score (0.326) with DMARC temperror and self-signed SSL certificate. The authentication issues combined with exfiltration risk warrant caution."
D84,Malicious,0.85,"Email has 4 YARA rule matches, high site visual similarity to known brand (0.967), 4 embedded files, multiple suspicious processes (winword.exe, powershell.exe, regsvr32.exe), and DMARC temperror. Multiple threat indicators confirm malicious intent."
D85,Spam,0.65,"Email has unsubscribe link present, wire transfer request type, and DMARC policy authentication. While potentially suspicious, the pattern suggests more likely spam/unwanted marketing rather than malicious content."
D86,No Action,0.55,"Email shows very low malicious indicators across all categories with passed SPF authentication and valid SSL certificate. All behavioral and content scores are minimal indicating legitimate email."
D87,No Action,0.50,"Email has clean technical indicators, passed SPF authentication, and minimal threat scores across all categories. No significant risk indicators present suggesting legitimate communication."
D88,No Action,0.45,"Email shows excellent authentication (passed SPF), minimal threat scores, and no suspicious request types. All security indicators suggest legitimate email with no action required."
D89,Warning,0.70,"Email has very high sender temp email likelihood (0.865), high DMARC enforcement, gift card request type (common in social engineering), and DMARC failure. The combination of temporary email and gift card request warrants warning."
D90,Warning,0.80,"Email contains packer detection, any_macro_enabled_document flag, wire transfer request, and multiple authentication failures (SPF fail, DMARC fail). The combination of obfuscated content and financial request requires warning classification."
D91,Malicious,0.85,"Email has return_path_known_malicious flag, high exfiltration behavior score (0.827), document download request, user_marked_as_spam_before flag, and multiple authentication failures. The confirmed malicious return path with high risk behaviors indicates malicious intent."
D92,No Action,0.55,"Email shows minimal threat indicators with passed authentication and low behavioral scores across all categories. No significant risk factors present indicating legitimate communication."
D93,Spam,0.70,"Email has high content spam score (0.851), sensitive data request type, and expired SSL certificate. The pattern suggests unsolicited bulk communication rather than targeted malicious activity."
D94,Warning,0.75,"Email contains malicious attachment count of 1, high exfiltration behavior score (0.736), meeting request type, and self-signed SSL certificate. The combination of malicious attachment and high exfiltration risk requires warning."
D95,Malicious,0.90,"Email has any_file_hash_malicious flag, very high exfiltration behavior score (0.993), high content spam score (0.822), user_marked_as_spam_before flag, and SSL validation issues. Multiple critical malicious indicators confirm threat."

D98,Malicious,0.90,"Email has very high metadata suspicious score (0.942), any_vbscript_javascript_detected flag, high exfiltration behavior score (0.264), link click request, and DMARC failure. The combination of script detection and high suspicious metadata confirms malicious intent."
D99,Warning,0.65,"Email contains unsubscribe link present, bank detail update request type, and DMARC temperror. The BEC-style request combined with authentication issues warrants caution despite otherwise clean indicators."
D100,Malicious,0.85,"Email has very high metadata suspicious score (0.723), unscannable attachment present, high exfiltration behavior score (0.421), VPN/MFA reset request, and expired SSL certificate.
