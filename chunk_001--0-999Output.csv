Data ID,Classification,Confidence Score,Detailed Justification
D1,Warning,0.75,Email shows moderate risk indicators with suspicious parent processes (acrobat.exe/cmd.exe/curl.exe/rundll32.exe) and high exfiltration score (0.90) suggesting potential data theft attempts. However lacks definitive malicious attachments and has partially passing authentication. The combination of suspicious processes and network behavior warrants caution but isn't definitively malicious.
D2,Malicious,0.85,Email contains multiple high-risk indicators: packer detected obfuscation, suspicious parent processes (winword.exe/powershell.exe/regsvr32.exe), high exfiltration score (0.99), network calls detected, and very high reply path reputation issues (0.91). Domain tech stack mismatch (1.0) indicates potential phishing. The combination of obfuscation and PowerShell execution strongly suggests malware delivery.
D3,No Action,0.95,Email appears benign with minimal risk indicators. No malicious attachments, no suspicious processes, clean authentication results (SPF fail but no other concerning signals), and legitimate request type (legal_threat). Low scores across behavioral and metadata analysis confirm safety.
D4,Warning,0.70,Email shows mixed signals with moderate metadata suspicion (0.023), high exfiltration potential (0.77), suspicious parent process (winword.exe), and authentication failures (DMARC fail). However no direct malicious content detected. The elevated behavioral scores suggest monitoring is warranted.
D5,No Action,0.90,Email presents minimal threat indicators with very low risk scores across all categories. Clean behavioral analysis, no suspicious processes, and standard authentication results. The low threat scores and absence of malicious indicators suggest a legitimate communication.
D6,No Action,0.85,Email shows low risk profile with minimal suspicious activity. Invoice verification request type is legitimate, no malicious attachments detected, and authentication mostly passing. Minor TLS security concerns but overall safe communication pattern.
D7,Malicious,0.80,Email exhibits high-risk behavior with suspicious process chains (acrobat.exe/cmd.exe/curl.exe/rundll32.exe), elevated exfiltration score (0.90), multiple authentication failures, and self-signed SSL certificate. The combination of suspicious execution patterns and poor security posture indicates likely malware or phishing attempt.
D8,No Action,0.88,Email appears legitimate with very low risk scores across all detection signals. Clean process execution, minimal suspicious behavior, and no malicious content detected. Authentication issues present but overall risk profile is low.
D9,Warning,0.65,Email from potentially malicious return path with temporary email likelihood (0.79) and authentication failures across SPF/DKIM/DMARC. Self-signed certificate and elevated TLS risk. While no direct malicious content, the sender reputation issues warrant caution.
D10,Warning,0.72,Email shows moderate risk with mixed behavioral scores, potential credential request, and authentication failures. Meeting request type is common but combined with other signals suggests possible spear phishing attempt targeting high-value individuals.
D11,Malicious,0.82,Email flagged for sensitive data request with extremely high SMTP reputation issues (0.88), self-signed certificate, and QR code marked as malicious. The combination of social engineering request type and technical red flags indicates likely data theft attempt.
D12,Warning,0.78,Email contains suspicious elements including embedded files, elevated behavioral scores, and process execution patterns (excel.exe/cmd.exe/powershell.exe). Self-signed certificate and high SMTP reputation risk (0.60) suggest potential threat but not definitively malicious.
